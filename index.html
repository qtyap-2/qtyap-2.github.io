Qtyap succeeded a Facebook group in the pre-Jio era where mobile internet was rare and costly. The
facebook group which cannot be named in public domain had a rich history of activity. Primarily because
that was a end when its members used to use it via laptop. The FB group had its own share of successful
campaigns such as image and profile sharing, spamming campaign of Lara the third(#LLRTN), creating
memes before it became mainstream. However, with mobile internet plans becoming cheap and
availability of smartphones, using social media on a laptop became a relic of the past. As a result, the TN
group was replaced by the Whatsapp group. Coincidently, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of
Facebook acquired Whatsapp in 2015 for 19 billion dollars to overcome this failure.
Qtyap's name just like its persona had an unknown back history. It was named Harshad Mulmuley after
he was infatuated with TVF - The Viral Fever studios. The Qtyap members were one of the early adopters
of the popular Indian Youtube channel. The name was given in the reference to the viral video - Rowdies

- Qtyapa which starred actors like Naveen Kasturia who later went on to become a household name in the
world of web-series. Impressed with Qtyap's success, the founder of TVF decided to name his Twitter
handle as theqtyapaguy.
Qtyap was founded by Mandar Hiwarkhedkar at Nagpur. The exact date of Qtyap 1 is unknown but it is
estimated to be around late 2012/early 2013 during job treat time. Though there was a significant
overlap with its predecessor, Qtyap's true value emerged after graduation when its members moved to
different cities across the world to earn their livelihood or to become a master. Though there was no
significant contribution or campaigns in the group, it had its own share of success when it was used as a
platform to organize the Pune Alumni meet. The Pune meet is remembered for Atharva Purohit's near
death experience of possibility of getting lost in a mall and flipping the bed apart.
On the evening of Sunday,3rd August 2014, Harshad Mulmuley was visiting the Brookefield apartment,
Bangalore after getting frustrated with sleeping with Piyush Kedar. Post having too much of Red sauce at
Taco bell at Cosmos mall, there was a dispute related to unknown reasons with Pune, Mumbai and
Banglaore members. As a result there were 9 groups created by multiple members with adding everyone
and non-admins leaving others group. After 6 hours of confusion and pure grade bakchodi, at the stroke
of midnight, only one group survived. Even though Harshad Mulmuley had created the group, adminship
was transferred to a random member,Prathamesh Jichkar. As Jichkar, a passive member, was occupied
at IIT-Kharagpur, he was not able to add/remove anyone and the group stayed.
Since, mobile number portability was not invented in 2014, Jichkar's number was deactivated and the
adminship was transferred to Abhishek Taori, another random member, atleast at that time. Even
though Taori, a wanderlust, was involved only in travel plans organised by Qtyap member, he was always
a passive member of Qtyap. But post the accidental admin rights, Taori emerged as one of the key
members of Qtyap and managed to keep the active well. Once after getting into XLRI after asking
permission from the security, he learned some valuables lessons of Bakodi and was able to deliver and
implement them on Qtyap.
Even though Taori was a capable admin, his rule couldnt last long and within 6 months, Nihit Agrawal,
the first of his name, the rightful admin of Qtyap, the cheapR, took over the most difficult task in the
world. He managed to keep the spirit of Qtyap alive and consolidated the members across 4 continents
and infinite cities successfully. The Qtyap which always had a highly unstable history was united under
the glorious leader until 2020. During the 5 year tenure Qtyap managed to scale new heights across the
industries. More than 10 members managed to get MBAs from reputed colleges. 6 got married, 1

cancelled his own after saying 'pencil', the guardian of Qtyap decided to go an enchanting
entrepreneurship journey including setting up the recording breaking music album by David Shukla.
More than half of the members lost their virginity in this illustrious tenure. In terms of multiple offsite
meets were organised at national and international locations, including 5+ trips to Goa and random
meetups in Australia, Japan, New York, Prague etc. Inspite of having innumerable ups, the tenure was
not a perfect one. The reign saw many instances of petty revolts including democratic elections where the
admin secured 100+ votes in a 18 member group, buying off the position from Bhoyar for 10 rupees
transfer via Paytm, and even colluding with the opposition for the thirst of power, but eventually the
truth prevailed and Bhaay's attempts were futile and were not able to destabilize the government.
In early 2020, the great admin decided to retire and hand-off the admin rights to the capable opposition
leader Abhishek Taori in the presence of the Hon. Name keeper, Shri Pratik Bhoyar as a part of Tashkent
Declaration 2.0. However, due to these unprecedented times of Covid-19 the Tashkent Declaration 2.0
was delayed and a world wide lockdown was announced. With a borrowed Netflix password, the admin
was watching the superhit Bollywood movie Pokhran while working from home. At this instant, another
minor revolt was organised by the great Bhaay. Inspired by the Atal ji's dialogue, 'admin aayege, admin
jayege but ye group rehna chahiye', the admin decided to pass on the reigns to a random member, Amit
Barwad, the Marvel meme-boy. The ceremony was conducted over a free 40-minute zoom call in the
presence the great Bhaay and was officiated by the group keeper, Hon Shri Qtyap Ratna Kaustubh
Shukla. Even though it was impossible for Barwad to fill in the shoes of the previous admin, he gave his
best to keep the group alive but the group fell into the dark age. The only time the group became active
was when the original admin was jobless.
